### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm kuantum (also known as kuanhulio). I make software from time to time and use Github to gather inspiration on what to do next.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a killer Flutter app.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter, Rust, Frontend Development.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Flutter.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Halo or why Python should be the new JavaScript.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can DM me on Discord (kuantum#0690) or email me at sami.n.altamimi@gmail.com   
- âš¡ Fun fact: If you were going at lightspeed across the universe, the odds of you hitting a star directly is very low.
